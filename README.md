# Python-exercises
Python exercises ranging from basic to complicated.

I also added the files into this repository using the git bash program.

# Git bash
if you ever get the error code "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/OishinSmith/Python-exercises.git'"
use "git push origin master -f" to solve the problem since it uses "force"
